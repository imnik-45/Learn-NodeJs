Learn NodeJs from Scratch with Code Snippets and More with MVC model.

## What is Node ?
    > Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
    > Node.js is an open source server environment.
    > Node.js is free.
    > Node.js runs on various platforms. (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
    > Node.js uses JavaScript on the server.
    > Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Module in Node.js

    > A set of functions you want to include in your application.
    > To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module.
   
## Node.js NPM

    > NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js.
    
## Node.js HTTP Module    
 
    > Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
     `var http = require('http'); `

 ## Notes

    >Install all the dependencies given in package json file.
    >Node Modules for this file is removed.

## Dependencies and Packages

    > Express - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
    > Ejs -  EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
    > Mongoose - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Nodejs.

## HTTP Request Methods
    > GET
    - The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
    > POST
    - The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
    > PUT
    - The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
    > DELETE
    - The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
    
### MiddleWare
     > Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
     > The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
     
    Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    -Execute any code.
    -Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    -End the request-response cycle.
    -Call the next middleware in the stack.
