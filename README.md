### MiddleWare
     >Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.     The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
     
    Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    -Execute any code.
    -Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    -End the request-response cycle.
    -Call the next middleware in the stack.
